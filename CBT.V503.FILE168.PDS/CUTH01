+  The%CUT+command is used to copy one or more lines of the data being edited
   to a temporary location from which it can later be retrieved using the
  %PASTE+command.  The temporary locations are erased when you logoff.

   To specify the lines to be put into the temporary location, use line
   commands%C+or%CC+to copy line(s), or%M+or%MM+to move lines, or use%labels+.

   If you specify a%level number+as part of the command, you can use multiple
   temporary locations, each of which you can later refer to with the%PASTE+
   command.  Level numbers are '1' thru '9'.  If you do not specify a level
   number, level '1' is used.

   A maximum of 1000 lines can be copied to each temporary location.
